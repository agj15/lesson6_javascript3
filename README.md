### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. DOM: It is a structure of objects with a set of properties and methods. It is an example of an API, otherwise known as an application programming interface. It has a hierachy and many different aspects that makes up what it is entirely. Its hierarchy depends on a document's contents. The DOM represents web page displayed in window
2. Node: Each item in the DOM tree is a node. Element, attribute, and text content are the most commonly used nodes. A newly created node is independent of a DOM tree. To add a new element to the HTML DOM, you must first create the element (which is the element node), and then append it to an existing element.
3. BOM: Stands for Browser object model and is commonly known as client-side object model. There is a hierachy of objects, just as their is a hierachy for the DOM. The most important object is the document object. The Top-level object in the browser object model is the window object.
